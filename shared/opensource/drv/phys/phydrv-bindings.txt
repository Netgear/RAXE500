PHY nodes
=========

PHY node must be a child device of a simple-bus (i.e MDIO), which has the required 'bus-type'
property, refering to bus_type_t bus name.
Each PHY driver might specify its own required and optional properties in addition to the properties
below detailed in it own binding txt file.

Required properties:

- reg:        The ID number for the phy, usually a small integer

- phy-type:   string, phydrv phy_type_t device driver type


Optional Properties:

- enet-phy-lane-swap: swap pair

- caps-no-hdx: Disable half duplex capability advertisement

- caps-no-5000: Disable 5G capability advertisement

- idle-stuffing:

- phy-reset:    gpio, if set, used to take phy out of reset before PHY initialization

# TODO: is this LPORT_SERDES specific ?
- serdes-tx-disable: The GPIO phandle and specifier for the SFP tx disable signal.
