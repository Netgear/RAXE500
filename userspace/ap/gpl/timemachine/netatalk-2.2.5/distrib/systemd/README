The service file of the current Netatalk is not appropriate because it use
a shell-script "netatalk.sh".

Two experimental files are here.

    netatalk.service
    netatalk-cnid.service

You can control starting/stopping by netatalk.service only
because netatalk-cnid.service is controlled automatically.

    # systemctl enable|disable netatalk.service
    # systemctl start|stop|restart netatalk.service

These files start daemons directly and do not read "netatalk.conf".
Therefore, you need to edit files for setting options.

    ATALK_NAME:       set in afpd.conf instead
    AFPD_MAX_CLIENTS: set in netatalk.service by using -c
    AFPD_UAMLIST:     set in afpd.conf instead
    AFPD_GUEST:       set in afpd.conf instead
    CNID_CONFIG:      set in netatalk-cnid.service by using -l and -f options

There are no service files for atalkd, papd, timelord and a2boot
because AppleTalk feature is due to be abolished in netatalk 3.0.
