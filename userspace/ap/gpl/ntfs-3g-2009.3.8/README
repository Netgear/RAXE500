INTRODUCTION
============

The NTFS-3G driver is an open source, freely available read/write NTFS driver 
for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, NetBSD, Solaris and Haiku. It provides safe and 
fast handling of the Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000, Windows 
Vista, and Windows Server 2008 file systems. 

The purpose of the project is to develop, continuously quality test and
support a trustable, featureful and high performance solution for hardware
platforms and operating systems whose users need to reliably interoperate
with NTFS. Besides this practical goal, the project also aims to explore
the limits of the hybrid, kernel/user space filesystem driver approach,
performance, reliability and feature richness per invested effort wise.

The driver is in STABLE status. The test methods, the test suites used
can be found at

News, support answers, problem submission instructions, support and discussion 
forums, performance numbers and other information are available on the project 
web site at

QUICK INSTALLATION
==================

Linux: Make sure you have the basic development tools and the kernel includes 
the FUSE kernel module. Then type:  

	./configure
	make
	make install      # or 'sudo make install' if you aren't root.

Please note that NTFS-3G doesn't require the FUSE user space package anymore.

Non-Linux: Please see the NTFS-3G web page for OS specific installation and 
source packages.


USAGE
=====

If there was no error during installation then the NTFS volume can be
read-write mounted for everybody the following way as the root user 
(unmount the volume if it was already mounted, and replace /dev/sda1 
and /mnt/windows, if needed):

	mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows
or
	ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows

Please see the ntfs-3g manual page for more options and examples.

You can also make NTFS to be mounted during boot by putting the below 
line at the __END__ of the /etc/fstab file:

	/dev/sda1 /mnt/windows ntfs-3g defaults 0 0
