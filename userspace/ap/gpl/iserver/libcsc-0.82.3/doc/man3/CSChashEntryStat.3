CSChashEntryStat(3)

NAME
        CSChashEntryStat - query the fields of a libcsc hash table entry

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSChashEntryStat (
                               CSChashEntryType    const entry,
                               CSChashKeyUnion**   const keyPtrPtr,
                               void**              const itemPtrPtr,
                               size_t*             const itemSizePtr
                               );

RETURN VALUE
        If successful, CSChashEntryStat() returns CSC_OK.  If entry is NULL,
        then CSC_BADARG is returned.  If libcsc was compiled with the DEBUG
        macro and the libcsc hash entry at entry is munged up, then CSC_CORRUPT
        is returned.

DESCRIPTION
        CSChashEntryStat() queries the libcsc hash table entry represented by
        the opaque `entry'.

        If `keyPtrPtr' is not NULL, then the a pointer to `entry''s key is
        written to the CSChashKeyUnion pointer that is pointed to by
        `keyPtrPtr'.

        If `itemPtrPtr' is not NULL, then `entry''s item pointer is written to
        the void pointer that is pointed to by `itemPtrPtr'.

        If `itemSizePtr' is not NULL, then the size, in bytes, of `entry''s
        item is written to the size_t pointed to by `itemSizePtr'.

BUGS
        This function provides one of the few ways to get direct access to a
        libcsc hash table's internal data.  Avoid using this function.
