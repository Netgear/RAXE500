CSCioBufRead(3)

NAME
        CSCioBufRead - read an ASCII buffer

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCioBufRead (
                           int                    fd,
                           void**           const dataPtrPtr,
                           size_t*          const sizePtr,
                           CSCmemListType   const memList,
                           int                    tagData
                           );

RETURN VALUE
        CSC_OK ....... successful

        CSC_BADARG ... fd is zero, or dataPtrPtr or sizePtr is NULL

        CSC_ERROR .... read error; no bytes to read, or maybe an odd count of
                       bytes where there was an expected even count

        CSC_NOMEM .... can't allocate memory for the read buffer

DESCRIPTION
        CSCioBufRead() reads from `fd' an ASCII representation of arbitrary
        bytes that are formatted as created by CSCioBufWrite(). The ASCII data
        is converted to binary data and stored in a single dynamically allocated
        memory block.

        The void pointer that is pointed to by `dataPtrPtr' is updated with the
        pointer to newly allocated memory containing the bytes read from fd.

        NOTE    Since the buffer is dynamically allocated with CSCmemAlloc(),
                the caller must free *bufPtrPtr with CSCmemFree() or
                CSCmemListFree() to avoid a memory leak.

        The size_t pointed to by `sizePtr' is updated to contain the number of
        bytes in the newly allocated buffer.

        Use CSCioBufWrite() and CSCioBufRead() to store and retrieve arbitrary
        binary data in portable ASCII format.

        `memList' and `tag' are as use with CSCmemAlloc().

EXAMPLE
        void*    data;
        size_t   size;

        // Read from fd (no NULL character received): "4\n12FACE55\n"

        stat = rtsIObufRead (fd, &data, &size);

        // Now: *data = 0x12, 0xFA, 0xCE, 0x55
        //      size  = 4;
