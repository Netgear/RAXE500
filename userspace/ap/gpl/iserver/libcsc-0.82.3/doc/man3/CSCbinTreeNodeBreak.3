CSCbinTreeNodeBreak(3)

NAME
        CSCbinTreeNodeBreak - break libcsc binary tree at a node

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCbinTreeNodeBreak (
                                  CSCbinTreeNodeType    const node,
                                  CSCbinTreeNodeType*   const leftPtr,
                                  CSCbinTreeNodeType*   const rightPtr
                                  );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCbinTreeNodeBreak() returns CSC_OK, unless node is NULL, in which
        case CSC_BADARG is returned.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCbinTreeNodeBreak() takes `node' and optionally replaces its left
        and/or right node pointers with NULL and writes its original left and/or
        right node pointers to the CSCbinTreeNodeTypethat are pointed to by
        `leftPtr' and `rightPtr'.

        NEVER, EVER do this to a node in a libcsc balanced binary tree.  Only
        use CSCbinTreeNodeBreak() on nodes in trees that are built with
        CSCbinTreeNodeJoin().

        If `leftPtr' is not NULL, then `node''s left node is written to the
        CSCbinTreeNodeType pointed to by `leftPtr'.

        If `rightPtr' is not NULL, then `node''s right node is written to the
        CSCbinTreeNodeType pointed to by `rightPtr'.

        Remember .....> Either of the left and/or right nodes that may be
                        returned via `leftPtr' and `rightPtr' may be NULL;
                        certainly this is the case when node is a leaf node.

BUGS
        Odd But True Department: If `leftPtr' and `rightPtr' are both NULL then
        no action is taken and CSC_OK is returned.
