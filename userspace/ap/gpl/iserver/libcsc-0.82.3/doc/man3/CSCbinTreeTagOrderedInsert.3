CSCbinTreeTagOrderedInsert(3)

NAME
        CSCbinTreeTagOrderedInsert - put node into libcsc balanced binary tree

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCbinTreeTagOrderedInsert (
                                         CSCbinTreeType       const tree,
                                         CSCbinTreeNodeType   const node
                                         );

RETURN VALUE
        CSC_OK ........ if successful.

        CSC_DUPKEY .... if `node' already exists in `tree' (this is defined
                        by the value of the nodes' tags).

        CSC_BADARG .... if libcsc was compiled with the DEBUG macro and `tree'
                        or `node' is NULL.

        CSC_CORRUPT ... if libcsc was compiled with the DEBUG macro and
                        CSCbinTreeTagOrderedInsert() detects something munged
                        up in the tree or in some internal data.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCbinTreeTagOrderedInsert() inserts `node' into the libcsc balanced
        binary tree `tree', and then CSCbinTreeTagOrderedInsert() maintains the
        balance.

        The insertion order is strictly based upon the tag field values of node
        and the tag field values of the nodes in the libcsc balanced binary
        tree.

        DANGER  Take care to never insert a node that was joined with another
                by using CSCbinTreeNodeJoin() because it lacks balance
                information and will completely whack a balanced tree.

        This function internally calls CSCbinTreeInsert() with its own internal
        tag comparison function.

        Insertion metrics, count comparisons and subtree rotations, can be
        gotten with CSCbinTreeStat().
