CSCstringBasename(3)

NAME
        CSCstringBasename - strip directory from a filename

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        char*   CSCstringBasename (
                                  char**   const pathPtrPtr
                                  );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCstringBinary() returns a pointer to the filename component of the
        pathname at *pathPtrPtr, if successful. Otherwise, CSCstringBinary()
        returns NULL, particularly if pathPtrPtr, or *pathPtrPtr is NULL.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCstringBinary() finds the first character after the last '/' character
        in the pathname pointed to by *pathPtrPtr. The last '/' character in the
        original string is replace will a NULL character.

        If the original pathname pointed to by *pathPtrPtr contains no '/'
        character, then CSCstringBinary() returns *pathPtrPtr, and sets
        *pathPtrPtr to be a pointer to the string "." (the current directory).

EXAMPLE
        char*   pathname = "just.a.file.name";
        file = CSCstringBasename (&pathname);

        // Now we have:
        //      file = "just.a.file.name"
        //      pathname = "."

        char*   pathname = "path/file";
        file = CSCstringBasename (&pathname);

        // Now we have:
        //      file = "file" ----v
        //      pathname = "path\0file"

BUGS
        If the original string has a '/' character, then that character gets
        set to '\0'; don't try this on components of argv and other strings
        that might not be writable.
