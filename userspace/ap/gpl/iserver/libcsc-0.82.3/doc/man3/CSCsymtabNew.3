RETURN VALUE
        CSCsymtabNew(), if successful, returns an opaque data type
        representing a new libcsc symbol table, or NULL if otherwise not
        successful.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCsymtabNew() creates a new libcsc symbol table of `size' entries, and
        initialized with a set of keywords.

        `name' points to an arbitrary string that is used as the name of the
        new libcsc symbol table.

        If `size' is zero, then a default size is used.  Since the symbol table
        is implemented as a hash table, the number of entries can be larger
        than size.

        If `keyWords' is NULL, then no keywords are loaded.  Otherwise, keyWords
        is an array of character pointers; a symbol is created and put into the
        new table for each keyword.  A list of keywords is terminated by a
        keyword of zero length, not a NULL keyword pointer.

        `keyWordType' is the value used for the keyword symbols' type field.
