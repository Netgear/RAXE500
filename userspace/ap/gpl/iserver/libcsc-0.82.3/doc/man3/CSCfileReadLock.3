NAME
        CSCfileReadLock - read-lock a region in a file

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCfileReadLock (
                              int     fd,
                              off_t   offset,
                              int     whence,
                              off_t   length
                              );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCfileReadLock() returns 0 if successful, otherwise -1 and errno will
        be set to indicate the error.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCfileReadLock() read locks a region of file associated with fd. The
        locked region in the file is at offset from beginning/end of the file
        depending upon the value of whence. The locked region is length bytes.

        whence usage is as follows:

        SEEK_SET
                The offset is set to offset bytes.

        SEEK_CUR
                The offset is set to its current location plus off-set bytes.

        SEEK_END
                The offset is set to the size of the file plus off-set bytes.
