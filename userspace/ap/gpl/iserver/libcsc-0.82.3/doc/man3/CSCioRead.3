CSCioRead(3)

NAME
        CSCioRead - read a specific number of bytes

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCioRead (
                        int            fd,
                        char*    const bufPtr,
                        size_t         size
                        );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCioRead() returns the number of bytes read. On read error, zero is
        returned. if `fd' is zero, `bufPtr' is NULL, or `size' is zero, then
        -1 is returned.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCioRead() reads `size' bytes from `fd' into `bufPtr' by calling the
        read() system call in a loop until `size' bytes is read, or until a
        read error.
