CSClistPop(3)

NAME
        CSClistPop - pop an entry from a libcsc list and retrieve its data

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSClistPop (
                         CSClistType       const list,
                         CSClistBiasType         bias,
                         void**            const itemPtrPtr,
                         size_t*           const itemSizePtr
                         );

RETURN VALUE
        CSClistPop(), if successful, returns CSC_OK; otherwise, CSC_NOTFOUND,
        CSC_BADARG, and CSC_CORRUPT can be returned corresponding to NULL
        pointers, bad function arguments, and internal data errors,
        respectively.

DESCRIPTION
        CSClistPop() pop the head (newest) or tail (oldest) entry from `list'
        depending upon the value of `bias'.  Valid values of `bias':

                CSC_LIST_HEAD   pop the head (newest) entry.

                CSC_LIST_TAIL   pop the tail (oldest) entry.

        The entry is removed from `list', and its data is retrieved.

        If `itemPtrPtr' is not NULL, then the popped entry's data pointer is
        written to the void pointer that is pointed to by `itemPtrPtr'.

        NOTE    If the retreived data was pushed into the list with the push
                type of CSC_DATA_DUP, then the retreived data is dynamically
                allocated (with malloc(), calloc(), etc.) and the caller is
                responsible for freeing (with free()) the retreived data.

        If `itemSizePtr' is not NULL, then the popped entry's data size is
        written to the size_t that is pointed to by `itemSizePtr'.
