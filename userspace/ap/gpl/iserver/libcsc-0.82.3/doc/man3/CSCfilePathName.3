SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        char*   CSCfilePathName (
                                const char*            const path,
                                      CSCmemListType   const memList,
                                      int                    memTag
                                );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCfilePathName() returns a pointer to a new string that begins with
        the first character in path and terminates with the last character
        preceding the last '/' character.

        CSCfilePathName() returns NULL if it is not successful.

DESCRIPTION
        If CSCfilePathName() is successful, it returns a pointer to a new
        string that is allocated by CSCmemAlloc(); the string must be freed
        with CSCmemFree() to avoid a memory leak.
