NAME
        CSCfileGetUserHomeDir - find home directory pathname of specific user

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        char*   cscFileGetUserHomeDir (
                                       const char*            const userName,
                                       const size_t                 pathSize,
                                             CSCmemListType   const memList,
                                             int                    memTag
                                      );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCfileGetUserHomeDir() returns a pointer to the home directory
        associated with the specific user name userName, if successful;
        otherwise, NULL is returned.

DESCRIPTION
        The returned home directory string should be a length less than or
        equal to `pathSize', including the terminating NULL character; if not,
        then an unterminated string containing `pathSize' characters is
        returned.

        If successful, CSCfileGetUserHomeDir() returns a pointer to a new
        string that is allocated by CSCmemAlloc(); the string must be freed
        with CSCmemFree() to avoid a memory leak.
