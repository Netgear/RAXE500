NAME
        CSCmemListWriteProfile - write a memlist profile to a file descriptor

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCmemListWriteProfile (
                                     CSCmemListType   const memList,
                                     int                    fd,

                                     );

RETURN VALUE
        CSC_OK ........ successful

        CSC_BADARG .... memList is NULL

        CSC_CORRUPT ... corruption is detected in memList
                        and CSCmemListWriteProfile() is compiled with DEBUG

DESCRIPTION
        CSCmemListWriteProfile() writes to `fd' the information of the
        dynamically allocated memory blocks that are described in `memList'.

        Use CSCmemListWriteProfile() and CSCmemListPrintProfile() to verify that
        there are no memory leaks.

        This information written by CSCmemListWriteProfile() begins with a
        header of the name, tag function, monitor function, and profiling as
        specified when `memList' was created by CSCmemInit(). If `memList' was
        specified when it was created by CSCmemInit() to be profiling, then the
        allocate count, free count, current allocating, and highest allocation
        are included in the header information.

        If `showing' is CSC_SHOW_ALL, then a list of allocationed/freeed blocks
        follows the header. The unfreed memory allocations are described by data
        address, size, and the allocate tag provided by the client code that
        called CSCmemAlloc(). If `memList' was specified to be profiling, then
        freed memory alocations remain in the list. In this case they will be
        included in this list of information but there is no data address and
        size, only an allocate tag and a free tag.

        If `showing' is CSC_SHOW_ALLOCATED, then only allocated blocks are
        shown.
