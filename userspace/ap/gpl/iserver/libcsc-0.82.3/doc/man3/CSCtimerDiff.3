CSCtimerDiff(3)

NAME
        CSCtimerStat - create and get current timer's time

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCtimerDiff (
                           CSCtimerType   const timer,
                           double*        const diffPtr
                           );

RETURN VALUE
        CSC_OK ........ successful

        CSC_ERROR ..... an error occurs trying to get system time or there was
                        no previous call to PRtimerMark() with the timer

        CSC_BADARG .... timer is NULL

        CSC_CORRUPT ... corruption is detected in timer
                        and CSCtimerDiff() is compiled with DEBUG

DESCRIPTION
        CSCtimerDiff() creates a time from the caller's previous call to
        CSCtimerMark() with `timer' and the call to this function. The
        difference is stored in a double as seconds.

        A previous call to PRtimerMark() must have been made with `timer'.

        If the `diffPtr' argument is not NULL, then CSCtimerDiff() writes to
        the double pointed to by `diffPtr' the difference between the marks
        taken with `timer'.
