NAME
        CSC2x - 2 to a the power of x, 0 <= x <= 30

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSC2x (
                    int   exponent
                    );

RETURN VALUE
DESCRIPTION
        CSC2x() returns 2 to the power of exponent, unless exponent is less
        than 0 or greater than 30, in which case CSC2x() returns -1.

        CSC2x() uses a table, so it is extremly fast.
