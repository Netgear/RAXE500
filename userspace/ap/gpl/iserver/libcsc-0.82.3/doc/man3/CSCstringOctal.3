CSCstringOctal(3)

NAME
        CSCstringOctal - format an ASCII string to represent an octal number

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        char*   CSCstringOctal (
                               char*   const bufPtr,
                               int32         item
                               );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCstringOctal() always returns bufPtr.

DESCRIPTION
        If `bufPtr' is not NULL, then the integer value of `item', in octal, is
        written to bufPtr with a preceding "0o" and is represented in 11 octets
        with the preceding two "0o" characters and terminating '\0' for a total
        of 14 characters.

EXAMPLE
        char*   buf[14]; // no smaller! and bigger is a waste.
        int32   i = 72;

        (void)CSCstringOctal (buf, i);
        //
        // Now: buf = "0o00000000110"

BUGS
        Beware buffer overflows; they are your responsibility.
