CSCfileExpandPath(3)

NAME
        CSCfileExpandPath - expand ~ and environment variables in pathname

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        char*   cscFileExpandPath (
                                  const char*            const path,
                                  const size_t                 pathMax,
                                        CSCmemListType   const memList,
                                        int                    memTag
                                  );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCfileExpandPath() returns a pointer to a newly allocated string, if
        successful; otherwise, it returns NULL on failure.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCfileExpandPath() expands the `~' character and environment variables
        in the string in the path argument. The new expanded string must be a
        length less than or equal to pathMax, including the terminating NULL
        character.

        If successful, cscFileExpandPath() returns a pointer to a new string
        that is allocated by rtsMemAlloc(); the string must be freed with
        CSCmemFree() to avoid a memory leak.
