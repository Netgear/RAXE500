NAME
	CSCnotificationPost - post to a notification in a board

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCnotificationPost (
                                        CSCnotificationBoardType   const board,
                                  const char*                            name
                                  );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCnotificationPost(), if successful, returns CSC_OK; otherwise,
        CSC_NOTFOUND, CSC_BADARG, and CSC_CORRUPT can be returned corresponding
        to NULL pointers, bad function arguments, and internal data errors,
        respectively.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCnotificationPost() dispatches all client functions registered for
        particular notification `name' in notification `board'.

        As the dispatched client functions are called they should return
        CSC_OK or CSC_NOTOUND.  If CSC_NOTFOUND is returned by a client
        function, then no more client functions registered for the notification
        are called for the particular notification action and and the
        notification's error function, pointed to by errfn, is called.  The
        error function, pointed to by errfn, is associated with the
        notification entry when the notification entry is created.  The error
        function's return value is ignored.

        The client functions are called in the order of their priority, which
        they specify with the tag value when they register.

        Client functions are libcsc CSCgenFnType types; their prototype is:

                int    (*CSCgenFnType) (int, int, void*);

        The client functions are called with a notification count,
        client-specified integer tag (used as the priority specifying the order
        in which the client functions are called), and client-specified data
        (with which they register):

                (*fn) (count, tag, data);
