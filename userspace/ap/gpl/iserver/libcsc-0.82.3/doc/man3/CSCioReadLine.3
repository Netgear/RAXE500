CSCioReadLine(3)

NAME
        CSCioReadLine - read bytes that are terminated by a newline

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCioReadLine (
                            int                    fd,
                            char**           const bufPtrPtr,
                            CSCmemListType   const memList,
                            int                    tagData
                            );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCioReadLine(), when successful, returns the number of bytes read
        from `fd'.

        CSCioReadLine() indicates error by returning -1. Errors are: `fd' is
        zero or `bufPtrPtr' is NULL, read error, or memory allocation error.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCioReadLine() reads bytes from `fd' until a newline character is
        encountered. The bytes are stored in a single dynamically allocated
        buffer; the pointer to the buffer is returned to the caller by writing
        the pointer to *bufPtrPtr.

        NOTE    Since the buffer is dynamically allocated with CSCmemAlloc(),
                the caller must free *bufPtrPtr with CSCmemFree() or
                CSCmemListFree() to avoid a memory leak.

        The terminating newline (maybe just LF or maybe CRLF) is in the returned
        data.

        `memList' and `tag' are as use with CSCmemAlloc().
