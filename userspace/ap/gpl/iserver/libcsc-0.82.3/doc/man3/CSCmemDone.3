CSCmemDone(3)

NAME
        CSCmemDone - cleanup and remove a memList (free all its memory)

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCmemDone (CSCmemListType const memList);

RETURN VALUE
        CSC_OK ......... successful

        CSC_BADARG ..... memList is NULL

        CSC_CORRUPT .... corruption is detected in memList
                         and CSCmemDone() is compiled with DEBUG

DESCRIPTION
        CSCmemDone() unconditionally remves all memory blocks contained in
        `memList' and then removes `memList' itself. `memList' is not checked
        for profiling; no statistics for `memList' are retained.

        Do not try to use `memList' after calling CSCmemDone(), at least until
        using `memList' in another CSCmemInit().

        If CSCmemDone() is compiled with DEBUG, then the memory is shredded
        by writing well-defined garbage to it before it is freed. This avoids
        code that accidentally works by using deallocated memory that hasn't
        yet changed.
