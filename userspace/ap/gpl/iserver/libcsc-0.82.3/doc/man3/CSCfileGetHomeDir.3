NAME
        CSCfileGetHomeDir - find home directory pathname

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        char*   CSCfileGetHomeDir (
                                  const size_t                 pathSize,
                                        CSCmemListType   const memList,
                                        int                    memTag
                                  );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCfileGetHomeDir() returns a pointer to the home directory associated
        with the user ID of the process, if successful; otherwise, NULL is
        returned.

DESCRIPTION
        The returned home directory string should be a length less than or
        equal to `pathSize', including the terminating NULL character; if not,
        then an unterminated string containing `pathSize' characters is
        returned.

        If successful, CSCfileGetHomeDir() returns a pointer to a new string
        that is allocated by CSCmemAlloc(); the string must be freed with
        CSCmemFree() to avoid a memory leak.
