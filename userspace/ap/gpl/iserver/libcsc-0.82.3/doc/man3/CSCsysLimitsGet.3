RETURN VALUE
        RTS_OK ........ successful

        CSC_BADARG .... fileOpenMaxPtr, or fileNameLengthPtr, or

DESCRIPTION
        CSCsysLimitsGet() makes some system calls and writes the integer
        information to the addresses specified in the arguments.

        `fileOpenMaxPtr' must be a non-NULL pointer to an integer. If the call
        to CSCsysLimitsGet() is successful, the integer value will be the
        maximum number of open files allowed per process.

        `fileNameLenghtPtr' must be a non-NULL pointer to an integer. If the
        call to CSCsysLimitsGet() is successful, the integer value will be the
        maximum files name length allowed by the system.

        `filePathLengthPtr' must be a non-NULL pointer to an integer. If the
        call to CSCsysLimitsGet() is successful, the integer value will be the
        maximum path length allowed by the system.
