CSCsymtabEntryNext(3)

NAME
        CSCsymtabEntryNext - find next entry in a libcsc symbol table

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        void*   CSCsymtabEntryNext (
                                   CSCsymTableType   const symTab,
                                   void*             const lhPtr
                                   );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCsymtabEntryNext(), if successful, returns an opaque symbol table
        entry.  If not successful, CSCsymtabEntryNext() returns NULL.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCsymtabEntryNext() uses the libcsc symbol table specified by the
        opaque `symTab' and returns a pointer to the next consecutive entry
        following the entry pointed to by `lhPtr'.  This next consecutive entry
        is the entry physically following the entry pointed to by `lhPtr'.

        If `lhPtr' is NULL, then the first item in the table is returned.

        If `symTab' is a table with no entries, or there are no more entries
        following the entry pointed to by `lhPtr', then NULL is returned.

BUGS
        There is no legitimate way for client code to know what to do with the
        void pointer returned from this function.  The secret is the returned
        value is a CSChashEntryType with its dataPtr field being a pointer to
        the symbol, but that might (very much not likely) change.
