NAME

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCnotificationNew (
                                       CSCnotificationBoardType   const board,
                                 const char*                            name,
                                       CSCgenFnType                     errfn
                                 );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCnotificationNew(), if successful, CSC_OK; otherwise, CSC_NOTFOUND,
        CSC_BADARG, and CSC_CORRUPT can be returned corresponding to NULL
        pointers, bad function arguments, and internal data errors,
        respectively.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCnotificationNew() creates a new notification entry and puts it into
        notification `board'.

        `name' points to the character string that names the new notification
        entry.

        `errfn' is a pointer to a libcsc CSCgenFnType function that is called
        when a call to `post' a notification, CSCnotificationPost() (which
        tries to distribute the notification), results in an an error.  The
        prototype for `errfn' is:

                int    (*CSCgenFnType) (int, int, void*);

        The client callback error function `errfn' is called with the current
        notification count and notification `name'; its return value is ignored:

                (void)((*errfn) (0, count, name);
