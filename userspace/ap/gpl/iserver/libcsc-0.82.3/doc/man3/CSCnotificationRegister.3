SYNOPSYS

        int   CSCnotificationRegister (
                                    CSCnotificationBoardType   const board,
                              const char*                            notifName,
                              const char*                            clientName,
                                    CSCgenFnType                     fn,
                              const CSCboolean*                      runFlag,
                                    int                              tag,
                              const void*                            data
                                      );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCnotificationRegister(), if successful, returns CSC_OK; otherwise,
        CSC_NOTFOUND, CSC_BADARG, and CSC_CORRUPT can be returned corresponding
        to NULL pointers, bad function arguments, and internal data errors,
        respectively.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCnotificationRegister() registers the client function pointed to by
        `fn' with the notification entry named by `notifName' in the
        notification board associated with `board'.

        Client functions are libcsc CSCgenFnType types; their prototype is:

                int    (*CSCgenFnType) (int, int, void*);

        The client functions are called with a notification count,
        client-specified integer tag, and client-specified data (with which
        they register):

                (*fn) (count, tag, data);

        Client functions should return CSC_OK or CSC_NOTOUND.  If CSC_NOTFOUND
        is returned by a client function, then no more client functions
        registered for the notification are called for the particular
        notification action, and and the notification's error function,
        pointed to by errfn, is called.  The error function, pointed to by
        errfn, is associated with the notification entry when the notification
        entry is created.  The error function's return value is ignored.

        `clientName' is used only for debug messages and notification board
        printing.

        When the notification named `notifName' is posted to, the function
        pointed to by `fn' is called.  `tag' and `data' are returned to the
        client as arguments to the client function `fn'.

        All client functions registered to a notification are called in order
        of their priority.  `tag' is used as the priority; all the client
        functions registered to a notification are called in the numerical
        value order of their tag.

        The client can dynamically control the calling of its registered
        function; if the value at `runFlag' is CSC_FALSE when the notification
        is posted to, then the registered client function will not be called.
