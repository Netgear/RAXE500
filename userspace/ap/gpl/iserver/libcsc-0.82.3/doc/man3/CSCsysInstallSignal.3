CSCsysInstallSignal(3)

NAME
        CSCsysInstallSignal - fairly portable signal installer

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        CSCsigFnType   CSCsysInstallSignal (
                                           const int              signo,
                                           const CSCsigFnType     func,
                                           const CSCsigModeType   mode
                                           );

RETURN VALUE
        The return value from CSCsysInstallSignal() is a function pointer to a
        signal handler.

        If CSCsysInstallSignal() is NOT successful, then the return value is
        SIG_ERR cast as a signal handler function.

        If CSCsysInstallSignal() is successful, then the return value is a
        function pointer to the previously installed handler cast as a
        signal handler function; this might be NULL in the typical case that
        there was no previous signal handler.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCsysInstallSignal() is a reliable version of signal() using POSIX
        sigaction().

        `signo' is the signal number of the signal for which the signal handler
        function `func' is installed.

        `mode' is CSC_SIG_INTERRUPT or CSC_SIG_RESTART; it is used to control
        behavior, specifically for slow system calls:

                mode                    behavior
                ----                    --------
                CSC_SIG_INTERRUPT       slow system calls are interrupted

                CSC_SIG_RESTART         slow system calls are not interrupted

        An illustration of slow system call and signal interrupt is a program
        that creates children and has a signal handler for SIGCHLD. If this
        program blocks on something like an accept() on a TCP socket connection
        and a child process terminates, then the registered SIGCHLD signal
        handler runs; but, the process unblocks and returns from the accept()
        with no connection (errno should be EINTR). This can be avoided by
        using CSCsysInstallSignal() to install the SIGCHLD signal handler
        function `func' and specifying CSC_SIG_RESTART for `mode'.
