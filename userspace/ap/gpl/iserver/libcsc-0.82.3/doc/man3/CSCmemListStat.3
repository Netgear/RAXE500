NAME
        CSCmemListStat - get information about a memList

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCmemListStat (
                             CSCmemListType   const memList,
                             size_t*          const allocCountPtr,
                             size_t*          const freeCountPtr,
                             size_t*          const maxMemAllocPtr,
                             size_t*          const curMemAllocPtr
                             );

RETURN VALUE
        CSC_OK ............. successful

        CSC_NO_PROFILING ... memList is not profiling

        CSC_BADARG ......... memList is NULL

        CSC_CORRUPT ........ corruption is detected in memList
                             and CSCmemListStat() is compiled with DEBUG

DESCRIPTION
        CSCmemListStat() can return the allocate count, free count, current
        allocating, and highest allocation from `memList', if `memList' was
        specified when it was created by CSCmemInit() to be profiling.

        When profiling:

                If `allocCountPtr' is not NULL, then CSCmemListStat() writes to
                the size_t pointed to by `allocCountPtr' the total number of
                allocates.

                If `freeCountPtr' is not NULL, then CSCmemListStat() writes to
                the size_t pointed to by `freeCountPtr' the total number of
                frees.

                If `maxMemAllocPtr' is not NULL, then CSCmemListStat() writes to
                the size_t pointed to by `maxMemAllocPtr' the number of bytes
                ever allocated at one time.

                If `curMemAllocPtr' is not NULL, then CSCmemListStat() writes to
                the size_t pointed to by `curMemAllocPtr' the number of
                currently allocated bytes.

        CSCmemListStat() can be used to determine if `memList' is profiling by
        using NULL for all of `allocCountPtr', `freeCountPtr', `maxMemAllocPtr',
        and `curMemAllocPtr'. CSC_NO_PROFILING is returned if `memList' is not
        profiling and CSC_OK is returned if `memList' is profiling.
