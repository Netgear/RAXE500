NAME
        CSCtimerStat - get current timer's time

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCtimerStat (
                           CSCtimerType   const timer,
                           double*        const diffPtr
                           );

RETURN VALUE
        CSC_OK ........ successful

        CSC_ERROR ..... at least one of the two marks has not been taken with
                        timer

        CSC_BADARG .... timer is NULL

        CSC_CORRUPT ... corruption is detected in timer
                        and CSCtimerStat() is compiled with DEBUG

DESCRIPTION
        CSCtimerStat() writes to the double pointed to by `diffPtr' the
        difference between the marks taken with `timer'. The difference is in
        seconds.

        Marks are taken with `timer' by using functions CSCtimerMark() and
        CSCtimerDiff(). The difference in seconds between CSCtimerMark() and
        CSCtimerDiff() is kept in `timer' as a double.

        The `timer's difference between marks is created by CSCtimerDiff();
        CSCtimerStat() merely returns the saved value.
