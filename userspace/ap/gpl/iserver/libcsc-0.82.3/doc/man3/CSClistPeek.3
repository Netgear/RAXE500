CSClistPeek(3)

NAME
        CSClistPeek - retrieve data from entry at libcsc list head or tail

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSClistPeek (
                          CSClistType       const list,
                          CSClistBiasType         bias,
                          void**            const itemPtrPtr,
                          size_t*           const itemSizePtr
                          );

RETURN VALUE
        CSClistPeek(), if successful, returns CSC_OK; otherwise,
        CSC_NOTFOUND, CSC_BADARG, and CSC_CORRUPT can be returned corresponding
        to NULL pointers, bad function arguments, and internal data errors,
        respectively.

DESCRIPTION
        CSClistPeek() peeks at the head (newest) or tail (oldest) entry in
        `list' and retrieves the data pointer and size.  When bias is:

        CSC_LIST_HEAD   If `itemPtrPtr' is not NULL, then the data pointer from
                        the list head (newest) entry is written to the void
                        pointer that is pointed to by `itemPtrPtr'.

                        If `itemSizePtr' is not NULL, then the data size from
                        the list head (newest) entry is written to the size_t
                        that is pointed to by `itemSizePtr'.

        CSC_LIST_TAIL   If `itemPtrPtr' is not NULL, then the data pointer from
                        the list tail (oldest) entry is written to the void
                        pointer that is pointed to by `itemPtrPtr'.

                        If `itemSizePtr' is not NULL, then the data size from
                        the list tail (oldest) entry is written to the size_t
                        that is pointed to by `itemSizePtr'.

        If both `itemPtrPtr' and `itemSizePtr' are NULL then CSClistPeek()
        doesn't do anything very interesting.
