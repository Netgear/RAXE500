CSCbinTreeStat(3)

NAME
        CSCbinTreeStat - retrieve libcsc balanced binary tree statistics

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCbinTreeStat (
                             CSCbinTreeType   const tree,
                             size_t*          const countPtr,
                             size_t*          const heightPtr,
                             size_t*          const comparesPtr,
                             size_t*          const rotatesPtr
                             );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCbinTreeStat() returns CSC_OK.

        If libcsc was compiled with the DEBUG macro and tree is NULL, then
        CSCbinTreeStat() returns CSC_BADARG.

        If libcsc was compiled with the DEBUG macro and some internal tree data
        is munged up, then CSCbinTreeStat() returns CSC_CORRUPT.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCbinTreeStat() retrieves these statistics from the libcsc balanced
        binary tree `tree':

                statistic
                ---------
                count ......... total number of nodes in the tree.
                height ........ maximum current height of the tree.
                compares ...... number of compares from most recent insert.
                rotates ....... number of rotations from most recent insert.

        If `countPtr' is not NULL, then the total number of nodes in the tree is
        written to the size_t pointed to by `countPtr'.

        If `heightPtr' is not NULL, then the maximum current height of the tree
        is written to the size_t pointed to by `heightPtr'.

        If `comparesPtr' is not NULL, then the number of compares from most
        recent insert is written to the size_t pointed to by `comparesPtr'.

        If `rotatesPtr' is not NULL, then the number of rotations from most
        recent insert is written to the size_t pointed to by `rotatesPtr'.

        If `countPtr', `heightPtr', `comparesPtr', and `rotatesPtr' are all
        NULL, then this function does nothing interesting.
