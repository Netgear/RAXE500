NAME
        CSCsockConnectUDP - initiate a socket connection

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCsockConnectUDP (
                                      int*           const socketPtr,
                                const char*                host,
                                const char*                service,
                                      CSCgenFnType         errorCallback
                                );

RETURN VALUE
        CSC_OK .......... successful, and the integer pointed to by socketPtr
                          will be updated with the new socket descriptor

        CSC_NOTFOUND .... can't make sense of host

        CSC_NOSVC ....... can't make sense of service

        CSC_NOPROT ...... can't make any sense out of the UDP protocol

        CSC_NOSOCK ...... can't allocate a new socket or can't set a socket
                          option

        CSC_BADARG ...... socketPtr or service is NULL or connectCount is zero

DESCRIPTION
        CSCsockConnectUDP() attempts to create a PF_INET (IPv4) protocol
        socket and make a UDP (SOCK_DGRAM) connection to another socket.

        The other socket to which to connect is expected to be on `host' and
        `service', where `host' is the hostname or IP address, and `service' is
        the service or port number. If `service' specifies port number, then the
        integer value must fit in an unsigned 16 bit variable
        (0 <= sevice <= 65535). For example:

                host            service
                ----            -------
                "batman"        "telnet"
                "spidergirl"    "5200"
                "198.168.0.2"   "finger"
                "198.168.0.2"   "5200"

        Error conditions are announced via `errorCallback', if it is not NULL.
        The `errorCallback' function is called with the CSCsockConnectUDP()
        return value, errno, and a string describing the error e.g.,

                (*errorCallback) (CSC_NOSOCK, errno, "can't create socket");

BUGS
        There's no "connection" in UDP! CSCsockConnectUDP() probably shouldn't
        call connect() to make a connection.
