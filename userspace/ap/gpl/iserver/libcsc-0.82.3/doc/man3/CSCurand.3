CSCurand(3)

NAME
        CSCurand - uniform random number generator

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCurand (
                       int       y,
                       double*   dptr
                       );

RETURN VALUE
        urand() returns a random int.

DESCRIPTION
        Urand is a Uniform/Universal RANDom number generator.

        The integer argument y should be initialized to some arbitrary non-zero
        number prior to the first call to CSCurand.

        Function CSCurand takes the form:  f(x) = a(x) + c(modulo m)

        m is 2 to the power of t for t-bit integers.  X, a, and c are
        themselves integers in the same range.  Some choices of a and c are
        good; urand chooses values suggested by Knuth (1969).  The scale factor
        that is used for converting y to a floating point value in the interval
        (0,1) is s = (double) 0.5 / halfm.

        CSCurand is taken from George E. Forsythe, Michael A. Malcolm, and Cleve
        B. Moler, "Computer Methods for Mathematical Programming" (Englewood
        Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1977), 246.

        CSCurand is based on theory and suggestions given in Donald E. Knuth
        "Seminumerical Algorithms," The Art of Computer Programming, vol. 2
        (Reading Mass.:  Addison-Wesley 1969).

BUGS
        Using CSCurand() always seems too difficult.
