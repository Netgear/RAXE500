CSCstringBinary(3)

NAME
        CSCstringBinary - format an ASCII string to represent a binary number

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        char*   CSCstringBinary (
                                char*   const bufPtr,
                                int32         item
                                );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCstringBinary() always returns bufPtr.

DESCRIPTION
        If `bufPtr' is not NULL, then the integer value of `item', in binary, is
        written to bufPtr with a preceding "0b" and is represented in 32 bits
        with the preceding two "0b" characters and terminating '\0' for a total
        of 35 characters.

EXAMPLE
        char*   buf[35]; // no smaller! and bigger is a waste.
        int32   i = 72;

        (void)CSCstringBinary (buf, i);
        //
        // Now: buf = "0b0000000001001000"

BUGS
        Beware buffer overflows; they are your responsibility.
