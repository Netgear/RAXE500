                          off_t   offset,
                          int     whence,
                          off_t   length
                          );

RETURN VALUE
        CSCfileUnlock() returns 0 if successful, otherwise -1 and errno will
        be set to indicate the error.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCfileUnlock() unlocks a region of file associated with fd. The
        unlocked region in the file is at offset from beginning/end of the
        file depending upon the value of whence. The unlocked region is
        length bytes.

        whence usage is as follows:

        SEEK_SET
                The offset is set to offset bytes.

        SEEK_CUR
                The offset is set to its current location plus off-set bytes.

        SEEK_END
                The offset is set to the size of the file plus off-set bytes.
