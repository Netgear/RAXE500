CSCbinTreeDel(3)

NAME
        CSCbinTreeDel - delete a libcsc balanced binary tree

SYNOPSYS
        #include "libcsc.h"

        int   CSCbinTreeDel (
                            CSCbinTreeType   const tree,
                            CSCgenFnType           cbFn
                            );

RETURN VALUE
        CSC_OK ......... if successful, and the opaque data structure
                         represented by `tree' will be deallocated.

        CSC_NOTFOUND ... if not successful.

        CSC_BADARG ..... if libcsc was compiled with the DEBUG macro and
                         `tree' or `cbFn' is NULL.

        CSC_CORRUPT .... if libcsc was compiled with the DEBUG macro and
                         CSCbinTreeDel() detects something munged up in the
                         tree or in some internal data.

DESCRIPTION
        CSCbinTreeDel() delete the balanced binary tree and the opaque
        CSCbinTreeType data structure represented by `tree'.  Probably the only
        way to get a valid CSCbinTreeType data structure in the first place is
        by calling CSCbinTreeNew().

        `cbFn' is a pointer to a libcsc CSCgenFnType function that is called for
        EACH NODE in the tree, before each node is deallocated.  The prototype
        for CSCgenFnType is:

                int    (*CSCgenFnType) (int, int, void*);

        The client callback function `cbFn' is called with the client defined
        node data:

                (*cbFn) (tag, dataSize, dataPtr);

        This gives the client an opportunity to process the client node data
        (such as CSCmemFree() any client CSCmemAlloc()'d node data) before the
        node is deallocated.

BUGS
        When CSCbinTreeDel() fails to deallocate internal nodes, in some
        conditions, CSC_OK may still be returned.
