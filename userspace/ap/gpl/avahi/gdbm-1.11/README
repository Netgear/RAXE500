* Introduction

This file contains brief information about configuring, testing
and using GNU dbm.  It is *not* intended as a replacement
for the documentation, instead it is provided as a brief reference
only. The complete documentation is available in doc/ subdirectory.
To read the manpage without installing the package use `man
doc/gdbm.3'.  To read texinfo documentation without installing the
package, run `info -f doc/gdbm.info'.  After the package is installed
the documentation can be accessed by running `man gdbm' and
`info gdbm'.

* Overview

GNU dbm is a set of database routines that use extendible hashing and
works similar to the standard UNIX dbm routines.  The library provides
also an optional compatibility layer for UNIX-like dbm and ndbm calls.

* Configuration

   a)  configure [PARAMETERS]
   b)  make 

For a list of generic PARAMETERS, see the file INCLUDE.  The gdbm-specific
parameters are:

** --enable-memory-mapped-io

Enable the use of mmap(2) for I/O optimizations.  This is the default,
if mmap is available.  To disable mmap, use --disable-memory-mapped-io.

** --enable-libgdbm-compat

Build and install libgdbm_compat, a compatibility layer which provides
UNIX-like dbm and ndbm interfaces.

** --enable-gdbm-export

Build and install gdbmexport with the specified gdbm 1.8 library.

** --with-gdbm183-library=LIB

Build gdbmexport with specified (static) library.  LIB must be
a loader argument valid for the use with cc(1), e.g.: -lgdbm-1.8.

** --gdbm183-libdir=DIR

Build gdbmexport with the gdbm library from the specified directory.

** --gdbm183-includedir=DIR

Build gdbmexport with gdbm.h from the specified directory.
