<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

Before you can start using CTDB you must first install and configure a
bunch of linux boxes.<br><br>

After that you need to install and configure a cluster filesystem and
mount that cluster filesystem on all the linux boxes that will form
your cluster.<br><br>

Also, ensure that the cluster filesystem supports correct
posix locking semantics. A simple way to test this is to run <a
href="https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Ping_pong">ping_pong</a> utility
bundled with CTDB.<br><br>

<h1>Cluster filesystems</h1>
We have primarily used the GPFS filesystem for our testing but any
cluster filesystem should work as long as it provides correct file
locking.<br><br>

While we primarily test with GPFS, CTDB should work with almost any
other cluster filesystem as well.<br><br>

Please let us know your experiences in using other cluster filesystems.
