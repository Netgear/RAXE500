                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.4.1
                           April 12, 2016
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address the following CVEs:

o  CVE-2015-5370 (Multiple errors in DCE-RPC code)

o  CVE-2016-2110 (Man in the middle attacks possible with NTLMSSP)

o  CVE-2016-2111 (NETLOGON Spoofing Vulnerability)

o  CVE-2016-2112 (LDAP client and server don't enforce integrity)

o  CVE-2016-2113 (Missing TLS certificate validation)

o  CVE-2016-2114 ("server signing = mandatory" not enforced)

o  CVE-2016-2115 (SMB IPC traffic is not integrity protected)

o  CVE-2016-2118 (SAMR and LSA man in the middle attacks possible)

The number of changes are rather huge for a security release,
compared to typical security releases.

Given the number of problems and the fact that they are all related
to man in the middle attacks we decided to fix them all at once
instead of splitting them.

In order to prevent the man in the middle attacks it was required
to change the (default) behavior for some protocols. Please see the
"New smb.conf options" and "Behavior changes" sections below.

=======
Details
=======

o  CVE-2015-5370

   Versions of Samba from 3.6.0 to 4.4.0 inclusive are vulnerable to
   denial of service attacks (crashes and high cpu consumption)
   in the DCE-RPC client and server implementations. In addition,
   errors in validation of the DCE-RPC packets can lead to a downgrade
   of a secure connection to an insecure one.

   While we think it is unlikely, there's a nonzero chance for
   a remote code execution attack against the client components,
   which are used by smbd, winbindd and tools like net, rpcclient and
   others. This may gain root access to the attacker.

   The above applies all possible server roles Samba can operate in.

   Note that versions before 3.6.0 had completely different marshalling
   functions for the generic DCE-RPC layer. It's quite possible that
   that code has similar problems!

   The downgrade of a secure connection to an insecure one may
   allow an attacker to take control of Active Directory object
   handles created on a connection created from an Administrator
   account and re-use them on the now non-privileged connection,
   compromising the security of the Samba AD-DC.

o  CVE-2016-2110:

   There are several man in the middle attacks possible with
   NTLMSSP authentication.

   E.g. NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SIGN and NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_SEAL
   can be cleared by a man in the middle.

   This was by protocol design in earlier Windows versions.

   Windows Server 2003 RTM and Vista RTM introduced a way
   to protect against the trivial downgrade.

   See MsvAvFlags and flag 0x00000002 in
   https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc236646.aspx

   This new feature also implies support for a mechlistMIC
   when used within SPNEGO, which may prevent downgrades
   from other SPNEGO mechs, e.g. Kerberos, if sign or
   seal is finally negotiated.

   The Samba implementation doesn't enforce the existence of
   required flags, which were requested by the application layer,
   e.g. LDAP or SMB1 encryption (via the unix extensions).
   As a result a man in the middle can take over the connection.
   It is also possible to misguide client and/or
   server to send unencrypted traffic even if encryption
   was explicitly requested.

   LDAP (with NTLMSSP authentication) is used as a client
   by various admin tools of the Samba project,
   e.g. "net", "samba-tool", "ldbsearch", "ldbedit", ...

   As an active directory member server LDAP is also used
   by the winbindd service when connecting to domain controllers.

   Samba also offers an LDAP server when running as
   active directory domain controller.

   The NTLMSSP authentication used by the SMB1 encryption
   is protected by smb signing, see CVE-2015-5296.

o  CVE-2016-2111:

   It's basically the same as CVE-2015-0005 for Windows:

     The NETLOGON service in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2,
     Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2012 Gold
     and R2, when a Domain Controller is configured, allows remote
     attackers to spoof the computer name of a secure channel's
     endpoint, and obtain sensitive session information, by running a
     crafted application and leveraging the ability to sniff network
     traffic, aka "NETLOGON Spoofing Vulnerability".

   The vulnerability in Samba is worse as it doesn't require
   credentials of a computer account in the domain.

   This only applies to Samba running as classic primary domain controller,
   classic backup domain controller or active directory domain controller.

   The security patches introduce a new option called "raw NTLMv2 auth"
   ("yes" or "no") for the [global] section in smb.conf.
   Samba (the smbd process) will reject client using raw NTLMv2
   without using NTLMSSP.

   Note that this option also applies to Samba running as
   standalone server and member server.

   You should also consider using "lanman auth = no" (which is already the default)
   and "ntlm auth = no". Have a look at the smb.conf manpage for further details,
   as they might impact compatibility with older clients. These also
   apply for all server roles.

o  CVE-2016-2112:

   Samba uses various LDAP client libraries, a builtin one and/or the system
   ldap libraries (typically openldap).

   As active directory domain controller Samba also provides an LDAP server.

   Samba takes care of doing SASL (GSS-SPNEGO) authentication with Kerberos or NTLMSSP
   for LDAP connections, including possible integrity (sign) and privacy (seal)
   protection.

   Samba has support for an option called "client ldap sasl wrapping" since version
   3.2.0. Its default value has changed from "plain" to "sign" with version 4.2.0.

   Tools using the builtin LDAP client library do not obey the
   "client ldap sasl wrapping" option. This applies to tools like:
   "samba-tool", "ldbsearch", "ldbedit" and more. Some of them have command line
   options like "--sign" and "--encrypt". With the security update they will
   also obey the "client ldap sasl wrapping" option as default.

   In all cases, even if explicitly request via "client ldap sasl wrapping",
   "--sign" or "--encrypt", the protection can be downgraded by a man in the
   middle.

   The LDAP server doesn't have an option to enforce strong authentication
   yet. The security patches will introduce a new option called
   "ldap server require strong auth", possible values are "no",
   "allow_sasl_over_tls" and "yes".

   As the default behavior was as "no" before, you may
   have to explicitly change this option until all clients have
   been adjusted to handle LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_REQUIRED errors.
   Windows clients and Samba member servers already use
   integrity protection.

o  CVE-2016-2113:

   Samba has support for TLS/SSL for some protocols:
   ldap and http, but currently certificates are not
   validated at all. While we have a "tls cafile" option,
   the configured certificate is not used to validate
   the server certificate.

   This applies to ldaps:// connections triggered by tools like:
   "ldbsearch", "ldbedit" and more. Note that it only applies
   to the ldb tools when they are built as part of Samba or with Samba
   extensions installed, which means the Samba builtin LDAP client library is
   used.

   It also applies to dcerpc client connections using ncacn_http (with https://),
   which are only used by the openchange project. Support for ncacn_http
   was introduced in version 4.2.0.

   The security patches will introduce a new option called
   "tls verify peer". Possible values are "no_check", "ca_only",
   "ca_and_name_if_available", "ca_and_name" and "as_strict_as_possible".

   If you use the self-signed certificates which are auto-generated
   by Samba, you won't have a crl file and need to explicitly
   set "tls verify peer = ca_and_name".

o  CVE-2016-2114

   Due to a regression introduced in Samba 4.0.0,
   an explicit "server signing = mandatory" in the [global] section
   of the smb.conf was not enforced for clients using the SMB1 protocol.

   As a result it does not enforce smb signing and allows man in the middle attacks.

   This problem applies to all possible server roles:
   standalone server, member server, classic primary domain controller,
   classic backup domain controller and active directory domain controller.

   In addition, when Samba is configured with "server role = active directory domain controller"
   the effective default for the "server signing" option should be "mandatory".

   During the early development of Samba 4 we had a new experimental
   file server located under source4/smb_server. But before
   the final 4.0.0 release we switched back to the file server
   under source3/smbd.

   But the logic for the correct default of "server signing" was not
   ported correctly ported.

   Note that the default for server roles other than active directory domain
   controller, is "off" because of performance reasons.

o  CVE-2016-2115:

   Samba has an option called "client signing", this is turned off by default
   for performance reasons on file transfers.

   This option is also used when using DCERPC with ncacn_np.

   In order to get integrity protection for ipc related communication
   by default the "client ipc signing" option is introduced.
   The effective default for this new option is "mandatory".

   In order to be compatible with more SMB server implementations,
   the following additional options are introduced:
   "client ipc min protocol" ("NT1" by default) and
   "client ipc max protocol" (the highest support SMB2/3 dialect by default).
   These options overwrite the "client min protocol" and "client max protocol"
   options, because the default for "client max protocol" is still "NT1".
   The reason for this is the fact that all SMB2/3 support SMB signing,
   while there are still SMB1 implementations which don't offer SMB signing
   by default (this includes Samba versions before 4.0.0).

   Note that winbindd (in versions 4.2.0 and higher) enforces SMB signing
   against active directory domain controllers despite of the
   "client signing" and "client ipc signing" options.

o  CVE-2016-2118 (a.k.a. BADLOCK):

   The Security Account Manager Remote Protocol [MS-SAMR] and the
   Local Security Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol [MS-LSAD]
   are both vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. Both are application level
   protocols based on the generic DCE 1.1 Remote Procedure Call (DCERPC) protocol.

   These protocols are typically available on all Windows installations
   as well as every Samba server. They are used to maintain
   the Security Account Manager Database. This applies to all
   roles, e.g. standalone, domain member, domain controller.

   Any authenticated DCERPC connection a client initiates against a server
   can be used by a man in the middle to impersonate the authenticated user
   against the SAMR or LSAD service on the server.

   The client chosen application protocol, auth type (e.g. Kerberos or NTLMSSP)
   and auth level (NONE, CONNECT, PKT_INTEGRITY, PKT_PRIVACY) do not matter
   in this case. A man in the middle can change auth level to CONNECT
   (which means authentication without message protection) and take over
   the connection.

   As a result, a man in the middle is able to get read/write access to the
   Security Account Manager Database, which reveals all passwords
   and any other potential sensitive information.

   Samba running as an active directory domain controller is additionally
   missing checks to enforce PKT_PRIVACY for the
   Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol [MS-DRSR] (drsuapi)
   and the BackupKey Remote Protocol [MS-BKRP] (backupkey).
   The Domain Name Service Server Management Protocol [MS-DNSP] (dnsserver)
   is not enforcing at least PKT_INTEGRITY.

====================
New smb.conf options
====================

  allow dcerpc auth level connect (G)

    This option controls whether DCERPC services are allowed to be used with
    DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_CONNECT, which provides authentication, but no per
    message integrity nor privacy protection.

    Some interfaces like samr, lsarpc and netlogon have a hard-coded default
    of no and epmapper, mgmt and rpcecho have a hard-coded default of yes.

    The behavior can be overwritten per interface name (e.g. lsarpc,
    netlogon, samr, srvsvc, winreg, wkssvc ...) by using
    'allow dcerpc auth level connect:interface = yes' as option.

    This option yields precedence to the implementation specific restrictions.
    E.g. the drsuapi and backupkey protocols require DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_PRIVACY.
    The dnsserver protocol requires DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_INTEGRITY.

    Default: allow dcerpc auth level connect = no

    Example: allow dcerpc auth level connect = yes

  client ipc signing (G)

    This controls whether the client is allowed or required to use
    SMB signing for IPC$ connections as DCERPC transport. Possible
    values are auto, mandatory and disabled.

    When set to mandatory or default, SMB signing is required.

    When set to auto, SMB signing is offered, but not enforced and
    if set to disabled, SMB signing is not offered either.

    Connections from winbindd to Active Directory Domain Controllers
    always enforce signing.

    Default: client ipc signing = default

  client ipc max protocol (G)

    The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest protocol level that will
    be supported for IPC$ connections as DCERPC transport.

    Normally this option should not be set as the automatic negotiation phase
    in the SMB protocol takes care of choosing the appropriate protocol.

    The value default refers to the latest supported protocol, currently SMB3_11.

    See client max protocol for a full list of available protocols.
    The values CORE, COREPLUS, LANMAN1, LANMAN2 are silently upgraded to NT1.

    Default: client ipc max protocol = default

    Example: client ipc max protocol = SMB2_10

  client ipc min protocol (G)

    This setting controls the minimum protocol version that the will be
    attempted to use for IPC$ connections as DCERPC transport.

    Normally this option should not be set as the automatic negotiation phase
    in the SMB protocol takes care of choosing the appropriate protocol.

    The value default refers to the higher value of NT1 and the
    effective value of "client min protocol".

    See client max protocol for a full list of available protocols.
    The values CORE, COREPLUS, LANMAN1, LANMAN2 are silently upgraded to NT1.

    Default: client ipc min protocol = default

    Example: client ipc min protocol = SMB3_11

  ldap server require strong auth (G)

    The ldap server require strong auth defines whether the
    ldap server requires ldap traffic to be signed or
    signed and encrypted (sealed). Possible values are no,
    allow_sasl_over_tls and yes.

    A value of no allows simple and sasl binds over all transports.

    A value of allow_sasl_over_tls allows simple and sasl binds (without sign or seal)
    over TLS encrypted connections. Unencrypted connections only
    allow sasl binds with sign or seal.

    A value of yes allows only simple binds over TLS encrypted connections.
    Unencrypted connections only allow sasl binds with sign or seal.

    Default: ldap server require strong auth = yes

  raw NTLMv2 auth (G)

    This parameter determines whether or not smbd(8) will allow SMB1 clients
    without extended security (without SPNEGO) to use NTLMv2 authentication.

    If this option, lanman auth and ntlm auth are all disabled, then only
    clients with SPNEGO support will be permitted. That means NTLMv2 is only
    supported within NTLMSSP.

    Default: raw NTLMv2 auth = no

  tls verify peer (G)

    This controls if and how strict the client will verify the peer's
    certificate and name. Possible values are (in increasing order): no_check,
    ca_only, ca_and_name_if_available, ca_and_name and as_strict_as_possible.

    When set to no_check the certificate is not verified at all,
    which allows trivial man in the middle attacks.

    When set to ca_only the certificate is verified to be signed from a ca
    specified in the "tls ca file" option. Setting "tls ca file" to a valid file
    is required. The certificate lifetime is also verified. If the "tls crl file"
    option is configured, the certificate is also verified against
    the ca crl.

    When set to ca_and_name_if_available all checks from ca_only are performed.
    In addition, the peer hostname is verified against the certificate's
    name, if it is provided by the application layer and not given as
    an ip address string.

    When set to ca_and_name all checks from ca_and_name_if_available are performed.
    In addition the peer hostname needs to be provided and even an ip
    address is checked against the certificate's name.

    When set to as_strict_as_possible all checks from ca_and_name are performed.
    In addition the "tls crl file" needs to be configured. Future versions
    of Samba may implement additional checks.

    Default: tls verify peer = as_strict_as_possible

  tls priority (G) (backported from Samba 4.3 to Samba 4.2)

    This option can be set to a string describing the TLS protocols to be
    supported in the parts of Samba that use GnuTLS, specifically the AD DC.

    The default turns off SSLv3, as this protocol is no longer considered
    secure after CVE-2014-3566 (otherwise known as POODLE) impacted SSLv3 use
    in HTTPS applications.

    The valid options are described in the GNUTLS Priority-Strings
    documentation at http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html

    Default: tls priority = NORMAL:-VERS-SSL3.0

================
Behavior changes
================

o  The default auth level for authenticated binds has changed from
   DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_CONNECT to DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_INTEGRITY.
   That means ncacn_ip_tcp:server is now implicitly the same
   as ncacn_ip_tcp:server[sign] and offers a similar protection
   as ncacn_np:server, which relies on smb signing.

o  The following constraints are applied to SMB1 connections:

   - "client lanman auth = yes" is now consistently
     required for authenticated connections using the
     SMB1 LANMAN2 dialect.
   - "client ntlmv2 auth = yes" and "client use spnego = yes"
     (both the default values), require extended security (SPNEGO)
     support from the server. That means NTLMv2 is only used within
     NTLMSSP.

o  Tools like "samba-tool", "ldbsearch", "ldbedit" and more obey the
   default of "client ldap sasl wrapping = sign". Even with
   "client ldap sasl wrapping = plain" they will automatically upgrade
   to "sign" when getting LDAP_STRONG_AUTH_REQUIRED from the LDAP
   server.

                   Release Notes for Samba 4.4.0
                           March 22, 2016
                   =============================


This is the first stable release of the Samba 4.4 release series.


UPGRADING
=========

Nothing special.


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

Asynchronous flush requests
---------------------------

Flush requests from SMB2/3 clients are handled asynchronously and do
not block the processing of other requests. Note that 'strict sync'
has to be set to 'yes' for Samba to honor flush requests from SMB
clients.

s3: smbd
--------

Remove '--with-aio-support' configure option. We no longer would ever prefer
POSIX-RT aio, use pthread_aio instead.

samba-tool sites
----------------

The 'samba-tool sites' subcommand can now be run against another server by
specifying an LDB URL using the '-H' option and not against the local database
only (which is still the default when no URL is given).

samba-tool domain demote
------------------------

Add '--remove-other-dead-server' option to 'samba-tool domain demote'
subcommand. The new version of this tool now can remove another DC that is
itself offline.  The '--remove-other-dead-server' removes as many references
to the DC as possible.

samba-tool drs clone-dc-database
--------------------------------

Replicate an initial clone of domain, but do not join it.
This is developed for debugging purposes, but not for setting up another DC.

pdbedit
-------

Add '--set-nt-hash' option to pdbedit to update user password from nt-hash
hexstring. 'pdbedit -vw' shows also password hashes.

smbstatus
---------

'smbstatus' was enhanced to show the state of signing and encryption for
sessions and shares.

smbget
------
The -u and -p options for user and password were replaced by the -U option that
accepts username[%password] as in many other tools of the Samba suite.
Similary, smbgetrc files do not accept username and password options any more,
only a single "user" option which also accepts user%password combinations.
The -P option was removed.

s4-rpc_server
-------------

Add a GnuTLS based backupkey implementation.

ntlm_auth
---------

Using the '--offline-logon' enables ntlm_auth to use cached passwords when the
DC is offline.

Allow '--password' force a local password check for ntlm-server-1 mode.

vfs_offline
-----------

A new VFS module called vfs_offline has been added to mark all files in the
share as offline. It can be useful for shares mounted on top of a remote file
system (either through a samba VFS module or via FUSE).

KCC
---

The Samba KCC has been improved, but is still disabled by default.

DNS
---

There were several improvements concerning the Samba DNS server.

Active Directory
----------------

There were some improvements in the Active Directory area.

WINS nsswitch module
--------------------

The WINS nsswitch module has been rewritten to address memory issues and to
simplify the code. The module now uses libwbclient to do WINS queries. This
means that winbind needs to be running in order to resolve WINS names using
the nss_wins module. This does not affect smbd.

CTDB changes
------------

* CTDB now uses a newly implemented parallel database recovery scheme
  that avoids deadlocks with smbd.

  In certain circumstances CTDB and smbd could deadlock.  The new
  recovery implementation avoid this.  It also provides improved
  recovery performance.

* All files are now installed into and referred to by the paths
  configured at build time.  Therefore, CTDB will now work properly
  when installed into the default location at /usr/local.

* Public CTDB header files are no longer installed, since Samba and
  CTDB are built from within the same source tree.

* CTDB_DBDIR can now be set to tmpfs[:<tmpfs-options>]

  This will cause volatile TDBs to be located in a tmpfs.  This can
  help to avoid performance problems associated with contention on the
  disk where volatile TDBs are usually stored.  See ctdbd.conf(5) for
  more details.

* Configuration variable CTDB_NATGW_SLAVE_ONLY is no longer used.
  Instead, nodes should be annotated with the "slave-only" option in
  the CTDB NAT gateway nodes file.  This file must be consistent
  across nodes in a NAT gateway group.  See ctdbd.conf(5) for more
  details.

* New event script 05.system allows various system resources to be
  monitored

  This can be helpful for explaining poor performance or unexpected
  behaviour.  New configuration variables are
  CTDB_MONITOR_FILESYSTEM_USAGE, CTDB_MONITOR_MEMORY_USAGE and
  CTDB_MONITOR_SWAP_USAGE.  Default values cause warnings to be
  logged.  See the SYSTEM RESOURCE MONITORING CONFIGURATION in
  ctdbd.conf(5) for more information.

  The memory, swap and filesystem usage monitoring previously found in
  00.ctdb and 40.fs_use is no longer available.  Therefore,
  configuration variables CTDB_CHECK_FS_USE, CTDB_MONITOR_FREE_MEMORY,
  CTDB_MONITOR_FREE_MEMORY_WARN and CTDB_CHECK_SWAP_IS_NOT_USED are
  now ignored.

* The 62.cnfs eventscript has been removed.  To get a similar effect
  just do something like this:

      mmaddcallback ctdb-disable-on-quorumLoss \
        --command /usr/bin/ctdb \
        --event quorumLoss --parms "disable"

      mmaddcallback ctdb-enable-on-quorumReached \
        --command /usr/bin/ctdb \
        --event quorumReached --parms "enable"

* The CTDB tunable parameter EventScriptTimeoutCount has been renamed
  to MonitorTimeoutCount

  It has only ever been used to limit timed-out monitor events.

  Configurations containing CTDB_SET_EventScriptTimeoutCount=<n> will
  cause CTDB to fail at startup.  Useful messages will be logged.

* The commandline option "-n all" to CTDB tool has been removed.

  The option was not uniformly implemented for all the commands.
  Instead of command "ctdb ip -n all", use "ctdb ip all".

* All CTDB current manual pages are now correctly installed


EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

SMB3 Multi-Channel
------------------

Samba 4.4.0 adds *experimental* support for SMB3 Multi-Channel.
Multi-Channel is an SMB3 protocol feature that allows the client
to bind multiple transport connections into one authenticated
SMB session. This allows for increased fault tolerance and
throughput. The client chooses transport connections as reported
by the server and also chooses over which of the bound transport
connections to send traffic. I/O operations for a given file
handle can span multiple network connections this way.
An SMB multi-channel session will be valid as long as at least
one of its channels are up.

In Samba, multi-channel can be enabled by setting the new
smb.conf option "server multi channel support" to "yes".
It is disabled by default.

Samba has to report interface speeds and some capabilities to
the client. On Linux, Samba can auto-detect the speed of an
interface. But to support other platforms, and in order to be
able to manually override the detected values, the "interfaces"
smb.conf option has been given an extended syntax, by which an
interface specification can additionally carry speed and
capability information. The extended syntax looks like this
for setting the speed to 1 gigabit per second:

    interfaces = 192.168.1.42;speed=1000000000

This extension should be used with care and are mainly intended
for testing. See the smb.conf manual page for details.

CAVEAT: While this should be working without problems mostly,
there are still corner cases in the treatment of channel failures
that may result in DATA CORRUPTION when these race conditions hit.
It is hence

    NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE MULTI-CHANNEL IN PRODUCTION

at this stage. This situation can be expected to improve during
the life-time of the 4.4 release. Feed-back from test-setups is
highly welcome.
